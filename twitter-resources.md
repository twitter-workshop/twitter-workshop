# Twitter Scraping Resources
Twitter scraping is hard. As a relatively new field of social science research, there is not a streamlined process or even an agreed upon procedure when it comes to collecting social media data.
Below are some helpful resources that can be used during the process.

### What exactly is an API?
**API** stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a software intermediary that allows for communication and interaction between two applications.
It specifies how software components should interact with one another. 
If you are interested in learning more about API, Sprout Social has [a simple and helpful article](https://sproutsocial.com/insights/what-is-an-api/) on what an API is and what it does.

## Twitter Developer
To take advantage of Twitter's API, you need a Twitter Developer account. You can set one up [HERE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access).

You will also need an app created with Twitter, which you can do [HERE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps).
- [Twitter Developer documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs) is the docs that Twitter has supplied on their API. These docs go through the basics and the variation between the different APIs that they offer.
- They also offer an [API Reference Index](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/api-reference-index) to quickly find what you might need.

## TwitterAPI
There are several different Python libraries available that attempt to simplify the process of Twitter scraping.
The one used in the workshop is called [TwitterAPI](https://github.com/geduldig/TwitterAPI).
- [TwitterAPI Docs](http://geduldig.github.io/TwitterAPI/index.html)

If, for whatever reason, you would like to explore other libraries that support Twitter API, the Twitter Developer website has made a list of libraries that are built for the Twitter platform by programming language.
You can find that list [HERE](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-utilities/twitter-libraries).
