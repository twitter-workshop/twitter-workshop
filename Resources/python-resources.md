# Python Resources
As the workshop only covers the basics, it may be helpful to learn more about how Python works and how you can use it. Below is a list of Python docs that might help you along the way.

### What is Python?
Python is a general programming language, first released in 1991. 
It is very popular as it emphasized readability and it is colloquially known as a "glue language" in programming. 
Notably, it is used in software development, web development, mathematics, and system scripting.
Python is dynamic and works on several different platforms. It can handle big data and is generally very quick.

### What is JSON?
JSON is **JavaScript Object Notation**. It is a more readable format for structuring data. When scraping tweets, all the objects and the keys will be returned in JSON. For more on JSON, you can read their [documentation on their website](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).

## Links
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) separates its documentation by version and goes through the basic installation process.
It also has wonderful reference guides for language and syntax, along with a glossary for when you encounter terms and do not know what they mean.
  - There is also a wonderful [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) which may be helpful to reference back to.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) is a great site that takes you through Python step-by-step with examples and exercises.
You have to pay for a certificate, but the tutorials and exercises are **free**. They also offer several different programming languages!
- [Real Python](https://www.realpython.com) has some of the most comprehensive and easy-to-read Python tutorials and tip sheets out there. 
Outside of the basics, they go through a lot of the fun  and specific things Python has to offer that you might not be able to find in basic programming courses.
The majority is free, but to access the entire library requires a membership.

## Courses
If a structured course is more your style, here are a few online courses that are worth looking into!
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) is mostly focused on data science, analytics, and visualization. 
They offer beginner to intermediate levels of difficulty, and take typically 4 to 10 hours per course.
The first nine beginner courses are free, afterwards it is $25/month.
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) offers **free** micro-courses in Python, machine learning, data visualization, and more! 
They also offer a community space to work on data sets or projects collaboratively.
